# When I will go broke

This is a simple application to simulate in how much time you will run out of money if you decide to buy a house, a car
and other expensive things.

The application is available at https://giovannibaratta.github.io/when-will-i-go-broke/.

> [!INFO]
> Available options are based on the italian market

## Status

At the moment, none of the logic and components are tested because it is an MVP product, and it does not serve any real
traffic.

## Serve it locally

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
